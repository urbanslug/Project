  abstract = {Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the major cause of acute lower respiratory tract infections in young children, but very little is known about its epidemiology and circulating genotypes in Pakistan. This study analyzed the epidemiological and molecular characteristics of RSV genotypes detected in Pakistani children less than 2 years of age with acute respiratory tract infections (ARIs) in a tertiary care hospital in Gilgit Baltistan (GB) province during 2011-12 winter season. RSV was detected in 75 out of 105 children presenting with acute respiratory infection. Male infants between 2-6 months age made up the highest percentage of RSV positive cases. Epidemiological factors such as pre-maturity, mean weight, clinical features and diagnosis when compared between RSV positive and negative groups were found to be statistically insignificant. Phylogenetic analysis classified all 75 of the RSV strains into 71 strains of subgroups A and 4 strains of subgroup B, respectively. Strains belonging to subgroups A and B were further subdivided into NA1/GA2 and BA, respectively. The nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequence identities were relatively high among these strains ({$>$}90\%). Both RSV-A and RSV-B isolates had two potential N-glycosylation sites in HVR2 of G protein and with heavy O-glycosylation of serine and threonine residues (G scores of 0.5-0.7). This report highlights the significance of RSV as a dominant viral etiologic agent of pediatric ARIs, and need for continued molecular epidemiological surveys for early detection of prevalent strains and newly emerging genotypes to understand epidemiology of RSV infections in various regions of Pakistan.},

RSV epidemiological data alone has been insufficient in defining who acquires infection from whom (WAIFW) within households.

Over an entire single RSV season in coastal Kenya, nasal swabs were collected from members of 20 households every 3\textendash 4 days regardless of symptom status and screened for RSV nucleic acid. Next generation sequencing was used to generate {$>$}90\% RSV full-length genomes for 51.1\% of positive samples (191/374). Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) observed during household infection outbreaks ranged from 0\textendash 21 (median: 3) while SNPs observed during single-host infection episodes ranged from 0\textendash 17 (median: 1). Using the viral genomic data alone there was insufficient resolution to fully reconstruct within-household transmission chains. For households with clear index cases, the most likely source of infant infection was via a toddler (aged 1 to {$<$}3 years-old) or school-aged (aged 6 to {$<$}12 years-old) co-occupant. However, for best resolution of WAIFW within households, we suggest an integrated analysis of RSV genomic and epidemiological data.},

  abstract = {Human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is associated with severe childhood respiratory infections. A clear description of local RSV molecular epidemiology, evolution, and transmission requires detailed sequence data and can inform new strategies for virus control and vaccine development. We have generated 27 complete or nearly complete genomes of RSV from hospitalized children attending a rural coastal district hospital in Kilifi, Kenya, over a 10-year period using a novel full-genome deep-sequencing process. Phylogenetic analysis of the new genomes demonstrated the existence and cocirculation of multiple genotypes in both RSV A and B groups in Kilifi. Comparison of local versus global strains demonstrated that most RSV A variants observed locally in Kilifi were also seen in other parts of the world, while the Kilifi RSV B genomes encoded a high degree of variation that was not observed in other parts of the world. The nucleotide substitution rates for the individual open reading frames (ORFs) were highest in the regions encoding the attachment (G) glycoprotein and the NS2 protein. The analysis of RSV full genomes, compared to subgenomic regions, provided more precise estimates of the RSV sequence changes and revealed important patterns of RSV genomic variation and global movement. The novel sequencing method and the new RSV genomic sequences reported here expand our knowledge base for large-scale RSV epidemiological and transmission studies.
IMPORTANCE The new RSV genomic sequences and the novel sequencing method reported here provide important data for understanding RSV transmission and vaccine development. Given the complex interplay between RSV A and RSV B infections, the existence of local RSV B evolution is an important factor in vaccine deployment.},

  abstract = {Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a global respiratory pathogen of humans, with infection occurring characteristically as recurrent seasonal epidemics. Unlike influenza viruses, little attention has been paid to the mechanism underlying worldwide spread and persistence of RSV and how this may be discerned through an improved understanding of the introduction and persistence of RSV in local communities. We analyzed 651 attachment (G) glycoprotein nucleotide sequences of RSV B collected over 11 epidemics (2002 to 2012) in Kilifi, Kenya, and contemporaneous data collected elsewhere in Kenya and 18 other countries worldwide (2002 to 2012). Based on phylogeny, genetic distance and clustering patterns, we set out pragmatic criteria to classify local viruses into distinct genotypes and variants, identifying those newly introduced and those locally persisting. Three genotypes were identified in the Kilifi data set: BA (n = 500), SAB1 (n = 148), and SAB4 (n = 3). Recurrent RSV epidemics in the local population were composed of numerous genetic variants, most of which have been newly introduced rather than persisting in the location from season to season. Global comparison revealed that (i) most Kilifi variants do not cluster closely with strains from outside Kenya, (ii) some Kilifi variants were closely related to those observed outside Kenya (mostly Western Europe), and (iii) many variants were circulating elsewhere but were never detected in Kilifi. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that year-to-year presence of RSV at the local level (i.e., Kilifi) is achieved primarily, but not exclusively, through introductions from a pool of variants that are geographically restricted (i.e., to Kenya or to the region) rather than global., IMPORTANCE The mechanism by which RSV persists and reinvades local populations is poorly understood. We investigated this by studying the temporal patterns of RSV variants in a rural setting in tropical Africa and comparing these variants with contemporaneous variants circulating in other countries. We found that periodic seasonal RSV transmission at the local level appears to require regular new introductions of variants. However, importantly, the evidence suggests that the source of new variants is mostly geographically restricted, and we hypothesize that year-to-year RSV persistence is at the country level rather than the global level. This has implications for control.},

  abstract = {RNA viruses replicate with high mutation rates, creating closely related viral populations. The heterogeneous virus populations, referred to as viral quasispecies, rapidly adapt to environmental changes thus adversely affecting efficiency of antiviral drugs and vaccines. Therefore, studying the underlying genetic heterogeneity of viral populations plays a significant role in the development of effective therapeutic treatments. Recent high-throughput sequencing technologies have provided invaluable opportunity for uncovering the structure of quasispecies populations. However, accurate reconstruction of viral quasispecies remains difficult due to limited read lengths and presence of sequencing errors. The problem is particularly challenging when the strains in a population are highly similar, that is, the sequences are characterized by low mutual genetic distances, and further exacerbated if some of those strains are relatively rare; this is the setting where state-of-the-art methods struggle.In this article, we present a novel viral quasispecies reconstruction algorithm, aBayesQR, that uses a maximum-likelihood framework to infer individual sequences in a mixture from high-throughput sequencing data. The search for the most likely quasispecies is conducted on long contigs that our method constructs from the set of short reads via agglomerative hierarchical clustering; operating on contigs rather than short reads enables identification of close strains in a population and provides computational tractability of the Bayesian method. Results on both simulated and real HIV-1 data demonstrate that the proposed algorithm generally outperforms state-of-the-art methods; aBayesQR particularly stands out when reconstructing a set of closely related viral strains (e.g., quasispecies characterized by low diversity).},

Clinical and epidemiologic features of RSV disease suggest there are at least 4 distinct target populations for vaccines, the RSV na\"ive young infant, the RSV na\"ive child {$\geq$}6 months of age, pregnant women (to provide passive protection to newborns), and the elderly. These target populations raise different safety and efficacy concerns and may require different vaccination strategies. The highest priority target population is the RSV na\"ive child. The occurrence of serious adverse events associated with the first vaccine candidate for young children, formalin inactivated RSV (FI-RSV), has focused vaccine development for the young RSV na\"ive child on live virus vaccines. Enhanced disease is not a concern for persons previously primed by a live virus infection. A variety of live-attenuated viruses have been developed with none yet achieving licensure. New live-attenuated RSV vaccines are being developed and evaluated that maybe sufficiently safe and efficacious to move to licensure. A variety of subunit vaccines are being developed and evaluated primarily for adults in whom enhanced disease is not a concern. An attenuated parainfluenza virus 3 vector expressing the RSV F protein was evaluated in RSV na\"ive children. Most of these candidate vaccines have used the RSV F protein in various vaccine platforms including virus-like particles, nanoparticles, formulated with adjuvants, and expressed by DNA or virus vectors. The other surface glycoprotein, the G protein, has also been used in candidate vaccines. We now have tools to make and evaluate a wide range of promising vaccines. Costly clinical trials in the target population are needed to evaluate and select candidate vaccines for advancement to efficacy trials. Better data on RSV-associated mortality in developing countries, better estimates of the risk of long term sequelae such as wheezing after infection, better measures of protection in target populations, and data on the costs and benefits of vaccines for target populations are needed to support and justify funding this process. Addressing these challenges and needs should improve the efficiency and speed of achieving a safe and effective, licensed RSV vaccine.},

Viral quasispecies assembly is the reconstruction of strain-specific haplotypes from read data, and predicting their relative abundances within the mix of strains is an important step for various treatment-related reasons. Reference-genome-independent (``de novo'') approaches have yielded benefits over reference-guided approaches, because reference-induced biases can become overwhelming when dealing with divergent strains. While being very accurate, extant de novo methods only yield rather short contigs. The remaining challenge is to reconstruct full-length haplotypes together with their abundances from such contigs. We present Virus-VG as a de novo approach to viral haplotype reconstruction from pre-assembled contigs. Our method constructs a variation graph from the short input contigs without making use of a reference genome. Then, to obtain paths through the variation graph that reflect the original haplotypes, we solve a minimization problem that yields a selection of maximal-length paths that is optimal in terms of being compatible with the read coverages computed for the nodes of the variation graph. We output the resulting selection of maximal length paths as the haplotypes, together with their abundances. Benchmarking experiments on challenging simulated and real data sets show significant improvements in assembly contiguity compared to the input contigs, while preserving low error rates compared to the state-of-the-art viral quasispecies assemblers.

  abstract = {A viral quasispecies, the ensemble of viral strains populating an infected person, can be highly diverse. For optimal assessment of virulence, pathogenesis, and therapy selection, determining the haplotypes of the individual strains can play a key role. As many viruses are subject to high mutation and recombination rates, high-quality reference genomes are often not available at the time of a new disease outbreak. We present SAVAGE, a computational tool for reconstructing individual haplotypes of intra-host virus strains without the need for a high-quality reference genome. SAVAGE makes use of either FM-index\textendash based data structures or ad hoc consensus reference sequence for constructing overlap graphs from patient sample data. In this overlap graph, nodes represent reads and/or contigs, while edges reflect that two reads/contigs, based on sound statistical considerations, represent identical haplotypic sequence. Following an iterative scheme, a new overlap assembly algorithm that is based on the enumeration of statistically well-calibrated groups of reads/contigs then efficiently reconstructs the individual haplotypes from this overlap graph. In benchmark experiments on simulated and on real deep-coverage data, SAVAGE drastically outperforms generic de novo assemblers as well as the only specialized de novo viral quasispecies assembler available so far. When run on ad hoc consensus reference sequence, SAVAGE performs very favorably in comparison with state-of-the-art reference genome-guided tools. We also apply SAVAGE on two deep-coverage samples of patients infected by the Zika and the hepatitis C virus, respectively, which sheds light on the genetic structures of the respective viral quasispecies.},

Given that the use of a reference genome can introduce significant biases, de novo approaches are most suitable for this task. So far, reference-genome-independent assemblers have been shown to reconstruct haplotypes for mixed samples of limited complexity and genomes not exceeding 10000 bp in length.{$<$}/p{$><$}p{$>$}Here, we present VG-Flow, a de novo approach that enables full-length haplotype reconstruction from pre-assembled contigs of complex mixed samples. Our method increases contiguity of the input assembly and, at the same time, it performs haplotype abundance estimation. VG-Flow is the first approach to require polynomial, and not exponential runtime in terms of the underlying graphs. Since runtime increases only linearly in the length of the genomes in practice, it enables the reconstruction also of genomes that are longer by orders of magnitude, thereby establishing the first de novo solution to strain-aware full-length genome assembly applicable to bacterial sized genomes.{$<$}/p{$><$}p{$>$}VG-Flow is based on the \emph{flow variation graph} as a novel concept that both captures all diversity present in the sample and enables to cast the central contig abundance estimation problem as a flow-like, polynomial time solvable optimization problem. As a consequence, we are in position to compute maximal-length haplotypes in terms of decomposing the resulting flow efficiently using a greedy algorithm, and obtain accurate frequency estimates for the reconstructed haplotypes through linear programming techniques.{$<$}/p{$><$}p{$>$}Benchmarking experiments show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on mixed samples from short genomes in terms of assembly accuracy as well as abundance estimation. Experiments on longer, bacterial sized genomes demonstrate that VG-Flow is the only current approach that can reconstruct full-length haplotypes from mixed samples at the strain level in human-affordable runtime.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

A major goal of single-cell genomics is to complement gene-centric metagenomic data with whole-genome assemblies of uncultivated organisms. Assembly of single-cell data is challenging because of highly non-uniform read coverage as well as elevated levels of sequencing errors and chimeric reads. We describe SPAdes, a new assembler for both single-cell and standard (multicell) assembly, and demonstrate that it improves on the recently released E+V-SC assembler (specialized for single-cell data) and on popular assemblers Velvet and SoapDeNovo (for multicell data). SPAdes generates single-cell assemblies, providing information about genomes of uncultivatable bacteria that vastly exceeds what may be obtained via traditional metagenomics studies. SPAdes is available online (http://bioinf.spbau.ru/spades). It is distributed as open source software.},

Underlying heterogeneity enables the quasispecies to adapt to changing conditions and proliferate over the course of an infection. Determining genetic diversity of a virus (i.e., inferring haplotypes and their proportions in the population) is essential for understanding its mutation patterns, and for effective drug developments. Here, we present QSdpR, a method and software for the reconstruction of quasispecies from short sequencing reads. The reconstruction is achieved by solving a correlation clustering problem on a read-similarity graph and the results of the clustering are used to estimate frequencies of sub-species; the number of sub-species is determined using pseudo F index. Extensive tests on both synthetic datasets and experimental HIV-1 and Zika virus data demonstrate that QSdpR compares favorably to existing methods in terms of various performance metrics.},

  abstract = {Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is amongst the most important pathogenic infections of childhood and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Although there have been extensive studies of epidemiology, clinical manifestations, diagnostic techniques, animal models and the immunobiology of infection, there is not yet a convincing and safe vaccine available. The major histopathologic characteristics of RSV infection are acute bronchiolitis, mucosal and submucosal edema, and luminal occlusion by cellular debris of sloughed epithelial cells mixed with macrophages, strands of fibrin, and some mucin. There is a single RSV serotype with two major antigenic subgroups, A and B. Strains of both subtypes often co-circulate, but usually one subtype predominates. In temperate climates, RSV infections reflect a distinct seasonality with onset in late fall or early winter. It is believed that most children will experience at least one RSV infection by the age of 2 years. There are several key animal models of RSV. These include a model in mice and, more importantly, a bovine model; the latter reflects distinct similarity to the human disease. Importantly, the prevalence of asthma is significantly higher amongst children who are hospitalized with RSV in infancy or early childhood. However, there have been only limited investigations of candidate genes that have the potential to explain this increase in susceptibility. An atopic predisposition appears to predispose to subsequent development of asthma and it is likely that subsequent development of asthma is secondary to the pathogenic inflammatory response involving cytokines, chemokines and their cognate receptors. Numerous approaches to the development of RSV vaccines are being evaluated, as are the use of newer antiviral agents to mitigate disease. There is also significant attention being placed on the potential impact of co-infection and defining the natural history of RSV. Clearly, more research is required to define the relationships between RSV bronchiolitis, other viral induced inflammatory responses, and asthma.},

For many applications we want to build and store indexes of these databases but constructing such indexes is a challenge. Fortunately, many of these genomic databases are highly-repetitive\textemdash a characteristic that can be exploited to ease the computation of the Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT), which underlies many popular indexes. In this paper, we introduce a preprocessing algorithm, referred to as prefix-free parsing, that takes a text T as input, and in one-pass generates a dictionary D and a parse P of T with the property that the BWT of T can be constructed from D and P using workspace proportional to their total size and O(|T|)-time. Our experiments show that D and P are significantly smaller than T in practice, and thus, can fit in a reasonable internal memory even when T is very large. In particular, we show that with prefix-free parsing we can build an 131-MB run-length compressed FM-index (restricted to support only counting and not locating) for 1000 copies of human chromosome 19 in 2 h using 21~ GB of memory, suggesting that we can build a 6.73~GB index for 1000 complete human-genome haplotypes in approximately 102 h using about 1~TB of memory.},

  abstract = {Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have become the standard for data generation in studies of population genomics, as the 1000 Genomes Project (1000G). However, these techniques are known to be problematic when applied to highly polymorphic genomic regions, such as the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes. Because accurate genotype calls and allele frequency estimations are crucial to population genomics analyses, it is important to assess the reliability of NGS data. Here, we evaluate the reliability of genotype calls and allele frequency estimates of the single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) reported by 1000G (phase I) at five HLA genes (HLA-A, -B, -C, -DRB1, and -DQB1). We take advantage of the availability of HLA Sanger sequencing of 930 of the 1092 1000G samples and use this as a gold standard to benchmark the 1000G data. We document that 18.6\% of SNP genotype calls in HLA genes are incorrect and that allele frequencies are estimated with an error greater than {$\pm$}0.1 at approximately 25\% of the SNPs in HLA genes. We found a bias toward overestimation of reference allele frequency for the 1000G data, indicating mapping bias is an important cause of error in frequency estimation in this dataset. We provide a list of sites that have poor allele frequency estimates and discuss the outcomes of including those sites in different kinds of analyses. Because the HLA region is the most polymorphic in the human genome, our results provide insights into the challenges of using of NGS data at other genomic regions of high diversity.},

Analysis of the SH gene sequences from 12 RS virus strains isolated between 1956 and 1989 confirmed the homogeneity of the two subgroups, A and B, previously defined serologically. Although there is only 76\% deduced amino acid sequence identity of SH proteins between subgroups, there was little variation in deduced amino acid sequences within the subgroups; nucleotide homologies within the subgroups ranged between 93\% and 99\%. Forty-two isolates of RS virus from a single epidemic season (autumn/winter 1989) were also examined to determine their relatedness. For these isolates regions of both the SH and nucleocapsid protein genes of each isolate were amplified and these regions were further analysed by direct nucleotide sequencing or restriction mapping. It was possible to discriminate at least six different lineages (or substrains) of RS virus circulating at the same time and in the same locality.,},

One cDNA encoded a complete positive-sense version of the RSV genome (corresponding to the replicative intermediate RNA or antigenome), and each of the other four encoded a separate RSV protein, namely, the major nucleocapsid N protein, the nucleocapsid P phosphoprotein, the major polymerase L protein, or the protein from the 5' proximal open reading frame of the M2 mRNA [M2(ORF1)]. RSV was not produced if any of the five plasmids was omitted. The requirement for the M2(ORF1) protein is consistent with its recent identification as a transcription elongation factor and confirms its importance for RSV gene expression. It should thus be possible to introduce defined changes into infectious RSV. This should be useful for basic studies of RSV molecular biology and pathogenesis; in addition, there are immediate applications to the development of live attenuated vaccine strains bearing predetermined defined attenuating mutations.},

  abstract = {RNA viruses evolve rapidly. One source of this ability to rapidly change is the apparently high mutation frequency in RNA virus populations. A high mutation frequency is a central tenet of the quasispecies theory. A corollary of the quasispecies theory postulates that, given their high mutation frequency, animal RNA viruses may be susceptible to error catastrophe, where they undergo a sharp drop in viability after a modest increase in mutation frequency. We recently showed that the important broad-spectrum antiviral drug ribavirin (currently used to treat hepatitis C virus infections, among others) is an RNA virus mutagen, and we proposed that ribavirin's antiviral effect is by forcing RNA viruses into error catastrophe. However, a direct demonstration of error catastrophe has not been made for ribavirin or any RNA virus mutagen. Here we describe a direct demonstration of error catastrophe by using ribavirin as the mutagen and poliovirus as a model RNA virus. We demonstrate that ribavirin's antiviral activity is exerted directly through lethal mutagenesis of the viral genetic material. A 99.3\% loss in viral genome infectivity is observed after a single round of virus infection in ribavirin concentrations sufficient to cause a 9.7-fold increase in mutagenesis. Compiling data on both the mutation levels and the specific infectivities of poliovirus genomes produced in the presence of ribavirin, we have constructed a graph of error catastrophe showing that normal poliovirus indeed exists at the edge of viability. These data suggest that RNA virus mutagens may represent a promising new class of antiviral drugs.},

Instead, reads are mapped to a single reference, which can lead to poor characterization of regions of high sequence or structural diversity. We introduce a population reference graph, which combines multiple reference sequences and catalogs of variation. The genomes of new samples are reconstructed as paths through the graph using an efficient hidden Markov model, allowing for recombination between different haplotypes and additional variants. By applying the method to the 4.5-Mb extended MHC region on human chromosome 6, combining 8 assembled haplotypes, the sequences of known classical HLA alleles and 87,640 SNP variants from the 1000 Genomes Project, we demonstrate using simulations, SNP genotyping, and short-read and long-read data how the method improves the accuracy of genome inference and identified regions where the current set of reference sequences is substantially incomplete.},

Here we review the origin of the quasispecies concept and some biological implications of quasispecies dynamics. Two main aspects are addressed: (i) mutant clouds as reservoirs of phenotypic variants for virus adaptability and (ii) the internal interactions that are established within mutant spectra that render a virus ensemble the unit of selection. The understanding of viruses as quasispecies has led to new antiviral designs, such as lethal mutagenesis, whose aim is to drive viruses toward low fitness values with limited chances of fitness recovery. The impact of quasispecies for three salient human pathogens, human immunodeficiency virus and the hepatitis B and C viruses, is reviewed, with emphasis on antiviral treatment strategies. Finally, extensions of quasispecies to nonviral systems are briefly mentioned to emphasize the broad applicability of quasispecies theory.},

We investigated the genetic variability of RSV-A circulating in Ontario during 2010\textendash 2011 winter season by sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of the G glycoprotein gene. Among the 201 consecutive RSV isolates studied, RSV-A (55.7\%) was more commonly observed than RSV-B (42.3\%). 59.8\% and 90.1\% of RSV-A infections were among children {$\leq$}12 months and {$\leq$}5 years old, respectively. On phylogenetic analysis of the second hypervariable region of the 112 RSV-A strains, 110 (98.2\%) clustered within or adjacent to the NA1 genotype; two isolates were GA5 genotype. Eleven (10\%) NA1-related isolates clustered together phylogenetically as a novel RSV-A genotype, named ON1, containing a 72 nucleotide duplication in the C-terminal region of the attachment (G) glycoprotein. The predicted polypeptide is lengthened by 24 amino acids and includes a23 amino acid duplication. Using RNA secondary structural software, a possible mechanism of duplication occurrence was derived. The 23 amino acid ON1 G gene duplication results in a repeat of 7 potential O-glycosylation sites including three O-linked sugar acceptors at residues 270, 275, and 283. Using Phylogenetic Analysis by Maximum Likelihood analysis, a total of 19 positively selected sites were observed among Ontario NA1 isolates; six were found to be codons which reverted to the previous state observed in the prototype RSV-A2 strain. The tendency of codon regression in the G-ectodomain may infer a decreased avidity of antibody to the current circulating strains. Further work is needed to document and further understand the emergence, virulence, pathogenicity and transmissibility of this novel RSV-A genotype with a72 nucleotide G gene duplication.},

The RSVs were detected using the respiratory virus panel fast assay and single-tube RT-PCR, their nucleotides were sequenced, and they were tested for positive selection. Of the 165 positive samples, 131 (79.4\%) carried RSV-A and 34 (20.6\%) RSV-B; both groups co-circulated in all of the study periods, with RSV-A predominating in all the seasons except for winter 2010\textendash 2011, which had a predominance of RSV-B. Phylogenetic analysis of the RSV-A sequences identified genotypes NA1 and ON1, the second replacing the first during the last two years of the study period. The RSV-B belonged to genotypes BA9 and BA10. BA9 was detected in all the years of the study whereas BA only desultorily. Comparison of the subjects infected by RSV-A and RSV-B types did not reveal any significant differences, but the children infected by genotype A/NA1 more frequently had lower respiratory tract infections (p{$<$}0.0001) and required hospitalisation (p = 0.007) more often than those infected by genotype A/ON1. These findings show that RSV has complex patterns of circulation characterised by the periodical replacement of the predominant genotypes, and indicate that the circulation and pathogenic role of the different RSV strains should be investigated as each may have a different impact on the host. A knowledge of the correlations between types, genotypes and disease severity may also be important in order to be able to include the more virulent strains in future vaccines.},

These include the elderly, persons with cardiopulmonary diseases, and immunocompromised hosts. Epidemiological evidence indicates that the impact of RSV in older adults may be similar to that of nonpandemic influenza. In addition, RSV has been found to cause 2 to 5\% of adult community-acquired pneumonias. Attack rates in nursing homes are approximately 5 to 10\% per year, with significant rates of pneumonia (10 to 20\%) and death (2 to 5\%). Clinical features may be difficult to distinguish from those of influenza but include nasal congestion, cough, wheezing, and low-grade fever. Bone marrow transplant patients prior to marrow engraftment are at highest risk for pneumonia and death. Diagnosis of RSV infection in adults is difficult because viral culture and antigen detection are insensitive, presumably due to low viral titers in nasal secretions, but early bronchoscopy is valuable in immunosuppressed patients. Treatment of RSV in the elderly is largely supportive, whereas early therapy with ribavirin and intravenous gamma globulin is associated with improved survival in immunocompromised persons. An effective RSV vaccine has not yet been developed, and thus prevention of RSV infection is limited to standard infection control practices such as hand washing and the use of gowns and gloves.},

  abstract = {M2-1 protein of human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a transcription antitermination factor that is important for the efficient synthesis of full-length mRNAs as well as for the synthesis of polycistronic readthrough mRNAs, which are characteristic of nonsegmented negative-strand RNA viruses. The contributions of these effects to RSV sequential transcription were investigated with minigenomes which contained one to five genes which were either foreign marker genes or authentic RSV genes. When evaluated on a promoter-proximal gene, the effect of M2-1 on the synthesis of full-length mRNA was much greater for a long (1,212- or 1,780-nucleotide) gene (up to a 615-fold increase) than for a short (274-nucleotide) gene (less than a 2-fold increase). This was independent of whether the gene contained non-RSV or RSV-specific sequence. Once the polymerase had terminated prematurely, it was unable to reinitiate at a downstream gene. These studies also confirmed that M2-1 enhances the synthesis of polycistronic mRNAs and that the magnitude of this effect varied greatly among different naturally occurring gene junctions. The synthesis of polycistronic mRNAs, which presumably involves antitermination at the gene-end signal, required a higher level of M2-1 than did the synthesis of the corresponding monocistronic mRNAs. M2-1 did not have a comparable antitermination effect at the junction between the leader region and the first gene. In a minigenome containing the NS1 and NS2 genes in their authentic sequence context, synthesis of full-length NS1 and NS2 mRNAs in the absence of M2-1 was remarkably high (36 and 57\%, respectively, of the maximum levels observed in the presence of M2-1). In contrast, synthesis of mRNA from additional downstream genes was highly dependent on M2-1. Thus, RSV has the potential for two transcription programs: one in the absence of M2-1, in which only the NS1 and NS2 genes are transcribed, and one in the presence of M2-1, in which sequential transcription of the complete genome occurs. The dependence on M2-1 for transcription was greater for a gene in the fifth position from the promoter than for one in the third position. This indicates that under conditions where M2-1 is limiting, its concentration affects the gradient of transcription. Although M2-1 was found to have profound effects on transcription, it had no effect on replication of any minigenome tested, suggesting that it is not an active participant in RNA replication or regulation of RNA replication. Finally, since a permissive RSV infection is marked by a gradual increase in the intracellular accumulation of viral proteins including M2-1, we examined the relative abundances of various mRNAs during RSV infection for evidence of temporal regulation of transcription. None was found, implying that the availability of M2-1 during a permissive infection is sufficient at all times such that its concentration does not mediate temporal regulation of gene transcription.},

  abstract = {Completely sequencing genomes is expensive, and to save costs we often analyze new genomic data in the context of a reference genome. This approach distorts our image of the inferred genome, an effect which we describe as reference bias. To mitigate reference bias, I repurpose graphical models previously used in genome assembly and alignment to serve as a reference system in resequencing. To do so I formalize the concept of a variation graph to link genomes to a graphical model of their mutual alignment that is capable of representing any kind of genomic variation, both small and large. As this model combines both sequence and variation information in one structure it serves as a natural basis for resequencing. By indexing the topology, sequence space, and haplotype space of these graphs and developing generalizations of sequence alignment suitable to them, I am able to use them as reference systems in the analysis of a wide array of genomic systems, from large vertebrate genomes to microbial pangenomes. To demonstrate the utility of this approach, I use my implementation to solve resequencing and alignment problems in the context of Homo sapiens and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. I use graph visualization techniques to explore variation graphs built from a variety of sources, including diverged human haplotypes, a gut microbiome, and a freshwater viral metagenome. I find that variation aware read alignment can eliminate reference bias at known variants, and this is of particular importance in the analysis of ancient DNA, where existing approaches result in significant bias towards the reference genome and concomitant distortion of population genetics results. I validate that the variation graph model can be applied to align RNA sequencing data to a splicing graph. Finally, I show that a classical pangenomic inference problem in microbiology can be solved using a resequencing approach based on variation graphs.},

Whole genome consensus sequences represent the dominant virus subtype which does not provide sufficient information to resolve transmission events for rapidly spreading viruses with overlapping generations. We explored whether the within-host diversity of respiratory syncytial virus quantified from deep sequence data provides additional resolution to inform on who acquires infection from whom based on shared minor variants in samples that comprised epidemiological clusters and that shared similar genetic background. We report that RSV-A infections are characterized by low frequency diversity that occurs across the genome. Shared minor variant patterns alone, were insufficient to elucidate transmission chains within household members. However, they provided inference on potential transmission links where phylogenetic methods were uninformative of transmission when consensus sequences were identical. Interpretation of minor variant patterns was tractable only for small household outbreaks.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

The risk varied depending upon the intensity of the epidemic for a given season, the month of birth of the infant, and the level of passively acquired maternal antibody at the time of birth. Over 80\% of the children hospitalized were less than 6 months of age; thus, most were born during the six months preceding the peak of RS virus activity. The neutralizing antibody titers in cord sera of 68 infants with culture-proven infections before 6 months of age were significantly lower than those of 575 randomly selected cord samples of infants born during the same period. The level of antibody at the time of birth was directly correlated with age at the time of infection. In addition, infants with more severe illnesses had lower levels of antibody in serum collected near onset of illness than did infants with milder illnesses. These observations demonstrate protection against RS infection in early infancy that is correlated with the level of maternal antibody, but it is not known if this protection is mediated directly by the passively acquired antibody or by some other mechanism.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

We present a comparative study of its practical performance regarding a wide range of options on the dimensions of different coding schemes and tree shapes. Our results are both theoretical and experimental: (1) We show that the run-length {$\delta$} coding size of wavelet trees achieves the 0-order empirical entropy size of the original string with leading constant 1, when the string's 0-order empirical entropy is asymptotically less than the logarithm of the alphabet size. This result complements the previous works that are dedicated to analyzing run-length {$\gamma$}-encoded wavelet trees. It also reveals the scenarios when run-length {$\delta$} encoding becomes practical. (2) We introduce a full generic package of wavelet trees for a wide range of options on the dimensions of coding schemes and tree shapes.

For population genomic analysis, the colored de Bruijn graph is often used in order to take advantage of the massive sets of sequenced genomes available for each species. However, memory consumption of tools based on the de Bruijn graph is often prohibitive, due to the high number of vertices, edges or colors in the graph. In order to process large and complex genomes, most short-read assemblers based on the de Bruijn graph paradigm reduce the assembly complexity and memory usage by compacting first all maximal non-branching paths of the graph into single vertices. Yet, de Bruijn graph compaction is challenging as it requires the uncompacted de Bruijn graph to be available in memory.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Results{$<$}/h3{$>$} {$<$}p{$>$}We present a new parallel and memory efficient algorithm enabling the direct construction of the compacted de Bruijn graph without producing the intermediate uncompacted de Bruijn graph.

Bifrost makes full use of the dynamic index efficiency and proposes a graph coloring method efficiently mapping each \emph{k}-mer of the graph to the set of genomes in which it occurs. Experimental results show that our algorithm is competitive with state-of-the-art de Bruijn graph compaction and coloring tools.

Shotgun sequencing is a well-established biological and computational method used in practice. Many conventional algorithms for shotgun sequencing are based on the notion of pairwise fragment overlap. While shotgun sequencing infers a DNA sequence given the sequences of overlapping fragments, a recent and complementary method, called sequencing by hybridization (SBH), infers a DNA sequence given the set of oligomers that represents all subwords of some fixed length, k. In this paper, we propose a new computer algorithm for DNA sequence assembly that combines in a novel way the techniques of both shotgun and SBH methods. Based on our preliminary investigations, the algorithm promises to be very fast and practical for DNA sequence assembly.},

            A 2330 nucleotide sequence spanning the 1B (NS2), IC (NS1) and N genes and intergenic regions of human respiratory syncytial virus strain 18537, representing antigenic subgroup B, was determined by sequencing cloned cDNAs of intracellular mRNAs. Comparison with the previously reported sequences for strain A2 of subgroup A showed that 1B, 1C and N were highly conserved at the nucleotide level (78, 78 and 86\% identity, respectively) and at the amino acid level (92, 87 and 96\% identity, respectively). The gene-start signals were exactly conserved between subgroups, and the gene-end signals contained only a single nucleotide substitution each in 1B and N. In most cases intergenic and non-coding gene sequences that were not part of presumed transcriptive signals were much less well conserved (generally 50 to 71\%) than sequences that were part of translational open reading frames (82 to 86\%). The nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of the N gene and protein of the Long strain of subgroup A were determined by sequencing cDNA clones of intracellular mRNA; the nucleotide sequence (representing all but the first 10 nucleotides of the gene) contained 15 differences from that of the A2 strain, but the deduced amino acid sequences were identical.,},

Previously, on the basis of reactivity patterns with monoclonal antibodies, the greatest intersubgroup variation was shown to occur in the G protein, the putative attachment glycoprotein. To delineate the molecular basis for this variation, we have determined the nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of the G mRNAs and proteins representing a subgroup A (Long strain) and a subgroup B (18537 strain) virus. These sequences were compared to the available G mRNA sequence for another subgroup A (A2 strain) virus. The Long G protein shared 94\% amino acid identity with the A2 G protein. In contrast, the 18537 G protein shared only 53\% amino acid identity with the A2 sequence; interestingly, most of the sequence divergence occurred in the proposed extracellular domain of the G protein. This extensive divergence for the G protein was significantly greater than that observed for other RSV proteins. Despite this considerable divarication, the proposed extracellular domains of the G proteins contained a single region of highly conserved sequence and secondary structure that may represent a conserved structural or function domain, perhaps involved in attachment to cellular receptors. Furthermore, this conserved region may comprise part of an epitope that is shared between the two subgroup G proteins and may significantly contribute to the fact that, despite extensive overall amino acid sequence divergence, the RSV G proteins maintain significant antigenic relatedness.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Home mechanical ventilation is dramatically evolving in Germany. Patients with non-invasive and invasive ventilation are increasingly treated at home. In-hospital treatment of these patients is also necessary either for control visits or the management of acute medical problems. However, the development of in-hospital patient care, morbidity and mortality of these patients is unknown. METHODS: All patients with long-term dependence on mechanical ventilation for more than three months requiring hospitalisation between 2006 and 2016 were analysed (data obtained from the Federal Statistical Office of Germany). RESULTS: There was an exponential increase in the number of in-patients with long-term dependence of mechanical ventilation. While 24 845 patients were treated in-hospital in 2006, 86 117 patients were treated in 2016.  Correspondingly, mortality decreased from 13.2 \% (2006) to 5.7 \% (2016). In addition, in 2016 47 \% of all patients were treated on the intensive care or high dependency care unit. Overall, patients had been severely ill, as there were plenty of medical and neurological co-morbidities. The most common diagnosis was  COPD with 58 \% of all cases, followed by several cardiology diagnosis. A high number of patients had an impairment of renal function (24 \%), in part requiring  dialysis. CONCLUSIONS: The rapid development of home mechanical ventilation substantially impacts on the development of the hospital landscape in Germany. The exponential increase of these care-intensive patients is challenging for the  health care system and requires a discussion about its limits.},

In addition, respiratory syncytial viral antigen was found in nasopharyngeal washings obtained from 15 of the 53 children. Seven of these children had RSV identified as the sole middle ear pathogen, whereas six children had otitis caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae as either the sole middle ear pathogen or in combination with RSV. Similarly, all three children with respiratory infections caused by influenza virus had ear infections caused by bacterial pathogens, either alone or in combination with influenza virus. These findings suggest that, in patients with viral respiratory infection, coexisting acute otitis media may be associated with the recovery of either viruses or bacteria from the middle ear exudates.},

The presence of low-frequency variants with few mutations with respect to major strains may result in an immune escape, emergence of drug resistance, and an increase of virulence and infectivity. Next-generation sequencing technologies permit detection of sample intra-host viral population at extremely great depth, thus providing an opportunity to access low-frequency variants. Long read lengths offered by single-molecule sequencing technologies allow all viral variants to be sequenced in a single pass. However, high sequencing error rates limit the ability to study heterogeneous viral populations composed of rare, closely related variants.{$<$}/p{$><$}p{$>$}In this article, we present CliqueSNV, a novel reference-based method for reconstruction of viral variants from NGS data. It efficiently constructs an allele graph based on linkage between single nucleotide variations and identifies true viral variants by merging cliques of that graph using combinatorial optimization techniques. The new method outperforms existing methods in both accuracy and running time on experimental and simulated NGS data for titrated levels of known viral variants. For PacBio reads, it accurately reconstructs variants with frequency as low as 0.1\%. For Illumina reads, it fully reconstructs main variants.

However, some of these technologies produce very short reads, typically of a few tens of base pairs, and to use these reads effectively requires new algorithms and software. In particular, there is a major issue in efficiently aligning short reads to a reference genome and handling ambiguity or lack of accuracy in this alignment. Here we introduce the concept of mapping quality, a measure of the confidence that a read actually comes from the position it is aligned to by the mapping algorithm. We describe the software MAQ that can build assemblies by mapping shotgun short reads to a reference genome, using quality scores to derive genotype calls of the consensus sequence of a diploid genome, e.g., from a human sample. MAQ makes full use of mate-pair information and estimates the error probability of each read alignment. Error probabilities are also derived for the final genotype calls, using a Bayesian statistical model that incorporates the mapping qualities, error probabilities from the raw sequence quality scores, sampling of the two haplotypes, and an empirical model for correlated errors at a site. Both read mapping and genotype calling are evaluated on simulated data and real data. MAQ is accurate, efficient, versatile, and user-friendly. It is freely available at http://maq.sourceforge.net.},

In many workflows, each of the short sequences (``reads'') resulting from a sequencing run are first ``mapped'' (aligned) to a reference sequence to infer the read from which the genomic location derived, a challenging task because of the high data volumes and often large genomes. Existing read mapping software excel in either speed (e.g., BWA, Bowtie, ELAND) or sensitivity (e.g., Novoalign), but not in both. In addition, performance often deteriorates in the presence of sequence variation, particularly so for short insertions and deletions (indels). Here, we present a read mapper, Stampy, which uses a hybrid mapping algorithm and a detailed statistical model to achieve both speed and sensitivity, particularly when reads include sequence variation. This results in a higher useable sequence yield and improved accuracy compared to that of existing software.},

  abstract = {A repetitive sequence collection is a set of sequences which are small variations of each other. A prominent example are genome sequences of individuals of the same or close species, where the differences can be expressed by short lists of basic edit operations. Flexible and efficient data analysis on such a typically huge collection is plausible using suffix trees. However, the suffix tree occupies much space, which very soon inhibits in-memory analyses. Recent advances in full-text indexing reduce the space of the suffix tree to, essentially, that of the compressed sequences, while retaining its functionality with only a polylogarithmic slowdown. However, the underlying compression model considers only the predictability of the next sequence symbol given the k previous ones, where k is a small integer. This is unable to capture longer-term repetitiveness. For example, r identical copies of an incompressible sequence will be incompressible under this model. We develop new static and dynamic full-text indexes that are able of capturing the fact that a collection is highly repetitive, and require space basically proportional to the length of one typical sequence plus the total number of edit operations. The new indexes can be plugged into a recent dynamic fully-compressed suffix tree, achieving full functionality for sequence analysis, while retaining the reduced space and the polylogarithmic slowdown. Our experimental results confirm the practicality of our proposal.},

However, the short read lengths of currently used sequencing approaches pose a limitation for identification of structural variants, sequencing repetitive regions, phasing alleles and distinguishing highly homologous genomic regions. These limitations may significantly contribute to the diagnostic gap in patients with genetic disorders who have undergone standard NGS, like whole exome or even genome sequencing. Now, the emerging long-read sequencing (LRS) technologies may offer improvements in the characterization of genetic variation and regions that are difficult to assess with the currently prevailing NGS approaches. LRS has so far mainly been used to investigate genetic disorders with previously known or strongly suspected disease loci. While these targeted approaches already show the potential of LRS, it remains to be seen whether LRS technologies can soon enable true whole genome sequencing routinely. Ultimately, this could allow the de novo assembly of individual whole genomes used as a generic test for genetic disorders. In this article, we summarize the current LRS-based research on human genetic disorders and discuss the potential of these technologies to facilitate the next major advancements in medical genetics.},

The motifs shared by ecological food webs were distinct from the motifs shared by the genetic networks of Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae or from those found in the World Wide Web. Similar motifs were found in networks that perform information processing, even though they describe elements as different as biomolecules within a cell and synaptic connections between neurons in Caenorhabditis elegans. Motifs may thus define universal classes of networks. This approach may uncover the basic building blocks of most networks.},

  abstract = {Sequencing in remote locations and resource-poor settings presents unique challenges. Nanopore sequencing can be successfully used under such conditions, and was deployed to West Africa during the recent Ebola virus epidemic, highlighting this possibility. In addition to its practical advantages (low cost, ease of equipment transport and use), this technology also provides fundamental advantages over second-generation sequencing approaches, particularly the very long read length, ability to directly sequence RNA, and real-time availability of data. Raw read accuracy is lower than with other sequencing platforms, which represents the main limitation of this technology; however, this can be partially mitigated by the high read depth generated. Here, we present a field-compatible protocol for sequencing of the mRNAs encoding for Niemann-Pick C1, which is the cellular receptor for ebolaviruses. This protocol encompasses extraction of RNA from animal blood samples, followed by RT-PCR for target enrichment, barcoding, library preparation, and the sequencing run itself, and can be easily adapted for use with other DNA or RNA targets.},

            Antigenic variation of human respiratory syncytial (RS) virus strains was analysed using a collection of nine, six, six, nine and one monoclonal antibodies respectively directed against the large glycoprotein (G), fusion protein (F), matrix protein (M), nucleoprotein (NP) and phosphoprotein (P) components of the Long strain of RS virus. A comparison was made with seven other strains isolated during different years in radioimmune precipitation analyses and immune fluorescence tests. Two different subtypes of the virus were demonstrable. Subtype A included the prototype strains Long and A2 and virus isolates from 1973, 1983 and 1984; subtype B included four virus strains isolated in successive years from 1979 to 1982. Subtype A viruses reacted with all the antibodies, whereas subtype B viruses showed different epitope characteristics in four structural components. The number of altered epitopes were 5/6, 1/2, 2/6 and 1/6 in the G, F, M and NP components, respectively. It is concluded that the two subtypes have evolved separately. The finding of two subtypes may explain previously observed strain variations in neutralization tests, and gives a new perspective on the immunobiology of RS virus.,},

household members, irrespective of symptoms, and tested for RSV by multiplex PCR. The RSV

assuming a random event time between observations, the average duration of virus shedding
was 11{$\cdot$}2 (95\% confidence interval 10{$\cdot$}1\textendash 12{$\cdot$}3) days. The shedding durations were longer than
previous estimates (3{$\cdot$}9\textendash 7{$\cdot$}4 days) based on immunofluorescence antigen detection or viral
culture, and were shown to be strongly associated with age, severity of infection, and
revealed potential interaction with other respiratory viruses. These findings are key to

  abstract = {The fragment assembly problem is that of reconstructing a DNA sequence from a collection of randomly sampled fragments. Traditionally, the objective of this problem has been to produce the shortest string that contains all the fragments as substrings, but in the case of repetitive target sequences this objective produces answers that are overcompressed. In this paper, the problem is reformulated as one of finding a maximum-likelihood reconstruction with respect to the two-sided Kolmogorov\textendash Smirnov statistic, and it is argued that this is a better formulation of the problem. Next the fragment assembly problem is recast in graph-theoretic terms as one of finding a noncyclic subgraph with certain properties and the objectives of being shortest or maximally likely are also recast in this framework. Finally, a series of graph reduction transformations are given that dramatically reduce the size of the graph to be explored in practical instances of the problem. This reduction is very important as the underlying problems are NP-hard. In practice, the transformed problems are so small that simple branch-and-bound algorithms successfully solve them, thus permitting auxiliary experimental information to be taken into account in the form of overlap, orientation, and distance constraints.Key words: shotgun DNA sequencing; fragment assembly; sequence rconstruction},

Generally, one of the two genotypes (A and B) predominates in a single season, alternating annually, although regional variation occurs. RSV is a cause of disease and death in children, older people, and immunocompromised patients, and its clinical effect on adults admitted to hospital is clarified with expanded use of multiplex molecular assays. Among adults, RSV produces a wide range of clinical symptoms including upper respiratory tract infections, severe lower respiratory tract infections, and exacerbations of underlying disease. Here we discuss the latest evidence on the burden of RSV related disease in adults, especially in those with immunocompromise or other comorbidities.

Deaths correlated strongly with influenza A and B reports, temperature, and interactions between aggregated URTI and temperature, and RSV outbreaks and temperature. Estimates of `seasonal' 4-weekly mortality associated with URTI were made by substituting into primary regression models the mean of annual trough consultation rates for aggregated URTI and baseline values for RSV and influenza. Peak 4-weekly mortality associated with URTIs was estimated at c. 24000 and c. 28000 during combined influenza and RSV epidemics of 1975\textendash 6 and 1989\textendash 90 respectively. Secondary regression analysis was carried out with the estimated `seasonal' 4-weekly deaths associated with URTI as dependant variable and laboratory data as regressors. Estimated excess mortality associated with influenza was considerable even during years without major epidemics. Overall during the 15 winters the estimated mortality associated with RSV was 60\textendash 80 \% more than that associated with influenza. The modelling permits only a crude estimate of RSV associated mortality. None the less it suggests that RSV is an important cause of winter mortality.},

Not only do the reads (or paired-end reads) need to straddle a breakpoint, but repetitive elements often lead to ambiguities in the alignment of short reads. We propose to use the long-reads (up to 20 kb) possible with 3rd generation sequencing, specifically nanopore sequencing on the MinION. Nanopore sequencing relies on a similar concept to a Coulter counter, reading the DNA sequence from the change in electrical current resulting from a DNA strand being forced through a nanometer-sized pore embedded in a membrane. Though nanopore sequencing currently has a relatively high mismatch rate that precludes base substitution and small frameshift mutation detection, its accuracy is sufficient for SV detection because of its long reads. In fact, long reads in some cases may improve SV detection efficiency.We have tested nanopore sequencing to detect a series of well-characterized SVs, including large deletions, inversions, and translocations that inactivate the CDKN2A/p16 and SMAD4/DPC4 tumor suppressor genes in pancreatic cancer. Using PCR amplicon mixes, we have demonstrated that nanopore sequencing can detect large deletions, translocations and inversions at dilutions as low as 1:100, with as few as 500 reads per sample. Given the speed, small footprint, and low capital cost, nanopore sequencing could become the ideal tool for the low-level detection of cancer-associated SVs needed for molecular relapse, early detection, or therapeutic monitoring.},

Adding this missing variation results in a structure that can be described as a mathematical graph: a genome graph. We demonstrate that, in comparison to the existing reference genome (GRCh38), genome graphs can substantially improve the fractions of reads that map uniquely and perfectly. Furthermore, we show that this fundamental simplification of read mapping transforms the variant calling problem from one in which many non-reference variants must be discovered de-novo to one in which the vast majority of variants are simply reidentified within the graph. Using standard benchmarks as well as a novel reference-free evaluation, we show that a simplistic variant calling procedure on a genome graph can already call variants at least as well as, and in many cases better than, a state-of-the-art method on the linear human reference genome. We anticipate that graph-based references will supplant linear references in humans and in other applications where cohorts of sequenced individuals are available.},

  abstract = {We present a generalization of the positional Burrows\textendash Wheeler transform, or PBWT, to genome graphs, which we call the gPBWT. A genome graph is a collapsed representation of a set of genomes described as a graph. In a genome graph, a haplotype corresponds to a restricted form of walk. The gPBWT is a compressible representation of a set of these graph-encoded haplotypes that allows for efficient subhaplotype match queries. We give efficient algorithms for gPBWT construction and query operations. As a demonstration, we use the gPBWT to quickly count the number of haplotypes consistent with random walks in a genome graph, and with the paths taken by mapped reads; results suggest that haplotype consistency information can be practically incorporated into graph-based read mappers. We estimate that with the gPBWT of the order of 100,000 diploid genomes, including all forms structural variation, could be stored and made searchable for haplotype queries using a single large compute node.},

  abstract = {Recent advances in single-cell genomics provide an alternative to gene-centric metagenomics studies, enabling whole genome sequencing of uncultivated bacteria. However, single-cell assembly projects are challenging due to (i) the highly non-uniform read coverage, and (ii) a greatly elevated number of chimeric reads and read pairs. While recently developed single-cell assemblers have addressed the former challenge, methods for assembling highly chimeric reads remain poorly explored. We present algorithms for identifying chimeric edges and resolving complex bulges in de Bruijn graphs, which significantly improve single-cell assemblies. We further describe applications of the single-cell assembler SPAdes to a new approach for capturing and sequencing ``dark matter of life'' that forms small pools of randomly selected single cells (called a mini-metagenome) and further sequences all genomes from the mini-metagenome at once. We demonstrate that SPAdes enables sequencing mini-metagenomes and benchmark it against various assemblers. On single-cell bacterial datasets, SPAdes improves on the recently developed E+V-SC and IDBA-UD assemblers specifically designed for single-cell sequencing. For standard (multicell) datasets, SPAdes also improves on A5, ABySS, CLC, EULER-SR, Ray, SOAPdenovo, and Velvet.},

The resulting recombinant vaccinia virus, vaccinia F, expressed the F1 and F2 cleavage products (48 and 20 kDa, respectively) of the F glycoprotein in cell culture. F1 and F2 were indistinguishable from their authentic RSV counterparts with respect to glycosylation, disulfide linkage, electrophoretic mobility, cell-surface expression, and antigenic specificity. Cotton rats infected intradermally with vaccinia F developed a high titer of serum F-specific antibodies, which neutralized infectivity of RSV. This neutralizing antibody response exceeded that induced by infection of the respiratory tract with RSV and was 6-fold higher than that induced by vaccinia G, a recombinant vaccinia virus that expressed the RSV G glycoprotein gene. Immunization with vaccinia F stimulated almost complete resistance to replication of RSV in the lower respiratory tract as well as significant resistance in the upper respiratory tract. The degree of resistance conferred by vaccinia F exceeded that induced by vaccinia G.},

However, because it excludes a great deal of common human variation, it introduces a pervasive reference bias into the field of human genomics. To reduce this bias, it makes sense to draw on representative collections of human genomes, brought together into reference cohorts. There are a number of techniques to represent and organize data gleaned from these cohorts, many using ideas implicitly or explicitly borrowed from graph based models. Here, we survey various projects underway to build and apply these graph based structures - which we collectively refer to as genome graphs - and discuss the improvements in read mapping, variant calling, and haplotype determination that genome graphs are expected to produce.},

In genome assembly and genetics, the possible paths through a superbubble can be considered to represent the set of possible sequences at a location in a genome. Bidirected and biedged graphs are a generalization of digraphs that are increasingly being used to more fully represent genome assembly and variation problems. Here we define snarls and ultrabubbles, generalizations of superbubbles for bidirected and biedged graphs, and give an efficient algorithm for the detection of these more general structures. Key to this algorithm is the cactus graph, which we show encodes the nested decomposition of a graph into snarls and ultrabubbles within its structure. We propose and demonstrate empirically that this decomposition on bidirected and biedged graphs solves a fundamental problem by defining genetic sites for any collection of genomic variations, including complex structural variations, without need for any single reference genome coordinate system. Furthermore, the nesting of the decomposition gives a natural way to describe and model variations contained within large variations, a case not currently dealt with by existing formats, e.g. VCF.},

  abstract = {Background
Recombinant inbred (RI) strains are an important resource for mapping complex traits in many species. While large RI panels are available for Arabidopsis, maize, C. elegans, and Drosophila, mouse RI panels typically consist of fewer than 30 lines. This is a severe constraint on the power and precision of mapping efforts and greatly hampers analysis of epistatic interactions.

Results
In order to address these limitations and to provide the community with a more effective collaborative RI mapping panel we generated new BXD RI strains from two independent advanced intercrosses (AI) between C57BL/6J (B6) and DBA/2J (D2) progenitor strains. Progeny were intercrossed for 9 to 14 generations before initiating inbreeding, which is still ongoing for some strains. Since this AI base population is highly recombinant, the 46 advanced recombinant inbred (ARI) strains incorporate approximately twice as many recombinations as standard RI strains, a fraction of which are inevitably shared by descent. When combined with the existing BXD RI strains, the merged BXD strain set triples the number of previously available unique recombinations and quadruples the total number of recombinations in the BXD background.

Conclusion
The combined BXD strain set is the largest mouse RI mapping panel. It is a powerful tool for collaborative analysis of quantitative traits and gene function that will be especially useful to study variation in transcriptome and proteome data sets under multiple environments. Additional strains also extend the value of the extensive phenotypic characterization of the previously available strains. A final advantage of expanding the BXD strain set is that both progenitors have been sequenced, and approximately 1.8 million SNPs have been characterized. This provides unprecedented power in screening candidate genes and can reduce the effective length of QTL intervals. It also makes it possible to reverse standard mapping strategies and to explore downstream effects of known sequence variants.},

  abstract = {Deep sequencing has enabled the investigation of a wide range of environmental microbial ecosystems, but the high memory requirements for de novo assembly of short-read shotgun sequencing data from these complex populations are an increasingly large practical barrier. Here we introduce a memory-efficient graph representation with which we can analyze the k-mer connectivity of metagenomic samples. The graph representation is based on a probabilistic data structure, a Bloom filter, that allows us to efficiently store assembly graphs in as little as 4 bits per k-mer, albeit inexactly. We show that this data structure accurately represents DNA assembly graphs in low memory. We apply this data structure to the problem of partitioning assembly graphs into components as a prelude to assembly, and show that this reduces the overall memory requirements for de novo assembly of metagenomes. On one soil metagenome assembly, this approach achieves a nearly 40-fold decrease in the maximum memory requirements for assembly. This probabilistic graph representation is a significant theoretical advance in storing assembly graphs and also yields immediate leverage on metagenomic assembly.},

To characterize the molecular epidemiology of HRSV strains over time, sequencing studies of a variable region of the attachment protein gene from a single community in the United States during 5 successive years were performed. Phylogenetic analysis revealed distinct clades (genotypes) that were further classified in subtypes based on \&gt; or = 96\% nucleotide similarity. Five genotypes and 22 subtypes among 123 group A HRSV isolates, and four distinct genotypes and six subtypes among 81 group B HRSV isolates were identified. One to two genotypes or subtypes accounted for \&gt; or = 50\% of isolates from a given year. A shift in the predominant genotype or subtype occurred each year such that no genotype or subtype predominated for more than 1 of the 5 study years. The consistency in the displacement of the predominant strain suggests that a shift, even within the same group, is advantageous to the virus. It was hypothesized that the \&apos;novel\&apos; strain is better able to evade previously induced immunity in the population and consequently either circulates more efficiently or is more pathogenic. The yearly shift in HRSV strains may contribute to the ability of HRSV to consistently cause yearly outbreaks of HRSV disease. These results also suggest that isolates may need to be characterized as to both group and genotype to fully understand protective immunity after natural infection and efficacy studies of candidate vaccines.,},

  abstract = {The number of genomic sequences is growing substantially. Besides discarding part of the data, the only efficient possibility for coping with this trend is data compression. We present an efficient compressor for genomic sequences, allowing both reference-free and referential compression. This compressor uses a mixture of context models of several orders, according to two model classes: reference and target. A new type of context model, which is capable of tolerating substitution errors, is introduced. For ensuring flexibility regarding hardware specifications, the compressor uses cache-hashes in high order models. The results show additional compression gains over several specific top tools in different levels of redundancy. The implementation is available at http://bioinformatics.ua.pt/software/geco/.},

We propose several new variants of Bloom filters and replacements with similar functionality. All of them have a better cache-efficiency and need less hash bits than regular Bloom filters. Some use SIMD functionality, while the others provide an even better space efficiency. As a consequence, we get a more flexible trade-off between false-positive rate, space-efficiency, cache-efficiency, hash-efficiency, and computational effort. We analyze the efficiency of Bloom filters and the proposed replacements in detail, in terms of the false-positive rate, the number of expected cache-misses, and the number of required hash bits. We also describe and experimentally evaluate the performance of highly tuned implementations. For many settings, our alternatives perform better than the methods proposed so far.},

  abstract = {Background:
              High-throughput whole genome sequencing facilitates investigation of minority virus sub-populations from virus positive samples. Minority variants are useful in understanding within and between host diversity, population dynamics and can potentially assist in elucidating person-person transmission pathways. Several minority variant callers have been developed to describe low frequency sub-populations from whole genome sequence data. These callers differ based on bioinformatics and statistical methods used to discriminate sequencing errors from low-frequency variants.
            
            
              Methods:
              We evaluated the diagnostic performance and concordance between published minority variant callers used in identifying minority variants from whole-genome sequence data from virus samples. We used the ART-Illumina read simulation tool to generate three artificial short-read datasets of varying coverage and error profiles from an RSV reference genome. The datasets were spiked with nucleotide variants at predetermined positions and frequencies. Variants were called using FreeBayes, LoFreq, Vardict, and VarScan2. The variant callers' agreement in identifying known variants was quantified using two measures; concordance accuracy and the inter-caller concordance.
            
            
              Results:
              The variant callers reported differences in identifying minority variants from the datasets. Concordance accuracy and inter-caller concordance were positively correlated with sample coverage. FreeBayes identified the majority of variants although it was characterised by variable sensitivity and precision in addition to a high false positive rate relative to the other minority variant callers and which varied with sample coverage. LoFreq was the most conservative caller.
            
            
              Conclusions:
              We conducted a performance and concordance evaluation of four minority variant calling tools used to identify and quantify low frequency variants. Inconsistency in the quality of sequenced samples impacts on sensitivity and accuracy of minority variant callers. Our study suggests that combining at least three tools when identifying minority variants is useful in~filtering errors when calling low frequency variants.},

Utilizing many rapidly emerging sequencing technologies, researchers have studied cancer genomes to understand the molecular statuses of cancer cells and to reveal their vulnerabilities, such as driver mutations or gene expression. Long-read technologies enable us to identify and characterize novel types of cancerous mutations, including complicated structural variants in haplotype resolution. In this review, we introduce three representative platforms for long-read sequencing and research trends of cancer genomics with long-read data. Further, we describe that aberrant transcriptome and epigenome statuses, namely, fusion transcripts, as well as aberrant transcript isoforms and the phase information of DNA methylation, are able to be elucidated by long-read sequencers. Long-read sequencing may shed light on novel types of aberrations in cancer genomics that are being missed by conventional short-read sequencing analyses.},

  abstract = {The functions of bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) nonstructural proteins NS1 and NS2 were studied by generation and analysis of recombinant BRSV carrying single and double gene deletions. Whereas in MDBK cells the lack of either or both NS genes resulted in a 5,000- to 10,000-fold reduction of virus titers, in Vero cells a moderate (10-fold) reduction was observed. Interestingly, cell culture supernatants from infected MDBK cells were able to restrain the growth of NS deletion mutants in Vero cells, suggesting the involvement of NS proteins in escape from cytokine-mediated host cell responses. The responsible factors in MDBK supernatants were identified as type I interferons by neutralization of the inhibitory effect with antibodies blocking the alpha interferon (IFN-{$\alpha$}) receptor. Treatment of cells with recombinant universal IFN-{$\alpha$} A/D or IFN-{$\beta$} revealed severe inhibition of single and double deletion mutants, whereas growth of full-length BRSV was not greatly affected. Surprisingly, all NS deletion mutants were equally repressed, indicating an obligatory cooperation of NS1 and NS2 in antagonizing IFN-mediated antiviral mechanisms. To verify this finding, we generated recombinant rabies virus (rRV) expressing either NS1 or NS2 and determined their IFN sensitivity. In cells coinfected with NS1- and NS2-expressing rRVs, virus replication was resistant to doses of IFN which caused a 1,000-fold reduction of replication in cells infected with wild-type RV or with each of the NS-expressing rRVs alone. Thus, BRSV NS proteins have the potential to cooperatively protect an unrelated virus from IFN-{$\alpha$}/{$\beta$} mediated antiviral responses. Interestingly, BRSV NS proteins provided a more pronounced resistance to IFN in the bovine cell line MDBK than in cell lines of other origins, suggesting adaptation to host-specific antiviral responses. The findings described have a major impact on the design of live recombinant BRSV and HRSV vaccines.},

We report the molecular epidemiology of HRSV in Niigata, Japan, over six successive seasons (from 2001 to 2007) and the emerging genotypes of HRSV subgroup A (HRSV-A) strains. A total of 488 HRSV samples were obtained from 1,103 screened cases in a pediatric clinic in Niigata. According to the phylogenetic analysis, among the PCR-positive samples, 338 HRSV-A strains clustered into the previously reported genotypes GA5 and GA7 and two novel genotypes, NA1 and NA2, which were genetically close to GA2 strains. One hundred fifty HRSV-B strains clustered into three genotypes, namely, GB3, SAB3, and BA, which has a 60-nucleotide insertion in the second hypervariable region of the G protein. The NA1 strains emerged first, in the 2004-2005 season, and subsequently, the NA2 strain emerged in the 2005-2006 season. Both strains caused large epidemics in the 2005-2006 and 2006-2007 seasons. The average age of children who were infected with NA2 strains was significantly higher than that of those infected with GA5 and the frequency of reinfection by NA2 was the highest among all genotypes, suggesting that this genotype possessed new antigenicity for evading past host immunity. This is the first paper to show a possible correlation between an emerging genotype, NA2, and large outbreaks of HRSV in Japan. Continuing studies to follow up the genetic changes and to clarify the mechanism of reinfection in HRSV are important steps to understand HRSV infections.},

  abstract = {Background: Virus genome sequences, generated in ever-higher volumes, can provide new scientific insights and inform our responses to epidemics and outbreaks. To facilitate interpretation, such data must be organised and processed within scalable computing resources that encapsulate virology expertise. GLUE (Genes Linked by Underlying Evolution) is a data-centric bioinformatics environment for building such resources. The GLUE core data schema organises sequence data along evolutionary lines, capturing not only nucleotide data but associated items such as alignments, genotype definitions, genome annotations and motifs. Its flexible design emphasises applicability to different viruses and to diverse needs within research, clinical or public health contexts.
Results: HCV-GLUE is a case study GLUE resource for hepatitis C virus (HCV). It includes an interactive public web application providing sequence analysis in the form of a maximum-likelihood-based genotyping method, antiviral resistance detection and graphical sequence visualisation. HCV sequence data from GenBank is categorised and stored in a large-scale sequence alignment which is accessible via web-based queries. Whereas this web resource provides a range of basic functionality, the underlying GLUE project can also be downloaded and extended by bioinformaticians addressing more advanced questions.
Conclusion: GLUE can be used to rapidly develop virus sequence data resources with public health, research and clinical applications. This streamlined approach, with its focus on reuse, will help realise the full value of virus sequence data.},

  abstract = {Using deep sequencing technologies such as Illumina\&rsquo;s platform, it is possible to obtain reads from the viral RNA population revealing the viral genome diversity within a single host. A range of software tools and pipelines can transform raw deep sequencing reads into Sequence Alignment Mapping (SAM) files. We propose that interpretation tools should process these SAM files, directly translating individual reads to amino acids in order to extract statistics of interest such as the proportion of different amino acid residues at specific sites. This preserves per-read linkage between nucleotide variants at different positions within a codon location. The samReporter is a subsystem of the GLUE software toolkit which follows this direct read translation approach in its processing of SAM files. We test samReporter on a deep sequencing dataset obtained from a cohort of 241 UK HCV patients for whom prior treatment with direct-acting antivirals has failed; deep sequencing and resistance testing have been suggested to be of clinical use in this context. We compared the polymorphism interpretation results of the samReporter against an approach that does not preserve per-read linkage. We found that the samReporter was able to properly interpret the sequence data at resistance-associated locations in nine patients where the alternative approach was equivocal. In three cases, the samReporter confirmed that resistance or an atypical substitution was present at NS5A position 30. In three further cases, it confirmed that the sofosbuvir-resistant NS5B substitution S282T was absent. This suggests the direct read translation approach implemented is of value for interpreting viral deep sequencing data.},

A comparison of morbidity and mortality caused by RSV in developed vs. developing countries is also presented.
        The seasons in which RSV epidemics occur typically depend on geographic location and altitude. During these seasons the epidemics tend to appear in clusters. Although the appearance pattern of these epidemics varies from one continent to another, they usually begin in coastal areas.
        RSV is the cause of one-fifth of lower respiratory infections worldwide. Generally RSV mortality is low, with a median value of zero. However, RSV mortality in developing countries is significantly higher than RSV mortality in developed countries.},

Here we describe an integrated set of eight structural variant classes comprising both balanced and unbalanced variants, which we constructed using short-read DNA sequencing data and statistically phased onto haplotype blocks in 26 human populations. Analysing this set, we identify numerous gene-intersecting structural variants exhibiting population stratification and describe naturally occurring homozygous gene knockouts that suggest the dispensability of a variety of human genes. We demonstrate that structural variants are enriched on haplotypes identified by genome-wide association studies and exhibit enrichment for expression quantitative trait loci. Additionally, we uncover appreciable levels of structural variant complexity at different scales, including genic loci subject to clusters of repeated rearrangement and complex structural variants with multiple breakpoints likely to have formed through individual mutational events. Our catalogue will enhance future studies into structural variant demography, functional impact and disease association.},

Between the two main antigenic subgroups of RS virus, there is antigenic variation in the attachment protein G. The antigenic differences between the subgroups appear to play a role in allowing repeated infections to occur. Antigenic differences also occur within subgroups; however, neither the extent of these differences nor their contributions to repeat infections are known. We report a molecular analysis of the extent of diversity within the subgroup B RS virus attachment protein genes of viruses isolated from children over a 30-year period. Amino acid sequence differences as high as 12\% were observed in the ectodomains of the G proteins among the isolates, whereas the cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains were highly conserved. The changes in the G-protein ectodomain were localized to two areas on either side of a highly conserved region surrounding four cysteine residues. Strikingly, single-amino-acid coding changes generated by substitution mutations were not the only means by which change occurred. Changes also occurred by (i) substitutions that changed the available termination codons, resulting in proteins of various lengths, and (ii) a mutation introduced by a single nucleotide deletion and subsequent nucleotide insertion, which caused a shift in the open reading frame of the protein in comparison to the other G genes analyzed. Fifty-one percent of the G-gene nucleotide changes observed among the isolates resulted in amino acid coding changes in the G protein, indicating a selective pressure for change. Maximum-parsimony analysis demonstrated that distinct evolutionary lineages existed. These data show that sequence diversity exists among the G proteins within the subgroup B RS viruses, and this diversity may be important in the immunobiology of the RS viruses.},

  abstract = {Bovine respiratory disease (BRD) is the most costly disease of beef cattle in North America. It is multi-factorial, with a variety of physical and physiological stressors combining to predispose cattle to pneumonia. However, efforts to discern which factors are most important have frequently failed to establish definitive answers. Calves are at highest risk shortly after transport. Risk factors include purchasing from sale barns and commingling. It is unclear whether or not these practices increase susceptibility, increase exposure, or are proxies for poor management. Lighter-weight calves appear to be at greater risk, although this has not been consistent. Persistent infection (PI) with bovine virus diarrhea virus increases BRD occurrence, but it is unclear if PI calves affect other cattle in the feedlot. The complexity of BRD has made it difficult to define involvement of individual factors. Stressors may play a role as ``necessary but not sufficient'' components, requiring additive effects to cause disease.},

Of the two subgroups of the virus, A and B, that cocirculate, A appears to be the most aggressive in infants, but protection against both will be required. Although a degree of protection is transferred from mother to the infant via the placenta and by breast feeding, the mechanisms of protection remain illunderstood and early hopes of exploiting this phenomenon have not been realized. The immune response to the virus in the very young is depressed but disease severity is not demonstrably linked to failure to control virus replication. Rather, immune mechanisms contribute directly to the development of bronchiolitis. The involvement of the immune response in the pathologic process increases the hazards of vaccination. Research is currently focused on the definition of viral epitopes necessary to induce only a protective immune response and their incorporation into a suitable vaccine vector.},

BA viruses have an exact duplication of 60 nucleotides in the G gene, starting after residue 791. This duplication is flanked by a repeat of four nucleotides (GUGU) and can fold into a relatively stable secondary structure. These features suggest a possible mechanism for the generation of a duplicated G segment. The predicted polypeptide is lengthened by 20 amino acids (residues 260\textendash 279) and this is reflected in the slower electrophoretic mobility of the G protein precursor of BA viruses compared with related viruses. The changes reported here expand the examples of drastic genetic alterations that can be introduced into the G protein sequence of HRSV while it replicates in its natural host.,},

This duplication was analogous to that previously described for other three viruses also isolated in Buenos Aires in 1999 (A. Trento et al., J. Gen. Virol. 84:3115-3120, 2003). Phylogenetic analysis indicated that BA sequences with that duplication shared a common ancestor (dated about 1998) with other HRSV G sequences reported worldwide after 1999. The duplicated nucleotide sequence was an exact copy of the preceding 60 nucleotides in early viruses, but both copies of the duplicated segment accumulated nucleotide substitutions in more recent viruses at a rate apparently higher than in other regions of the G protein gene. The evolution of the viruses with the duplicated G segment apparently followed the overall evolutionary pattern previously described for HRSV, and this genotype has replaced other prevailing antigenic group B genotypes in Buenos Aires and other places. Thus, the duplicated segment represents a natural tag that can be used to track the dissemination and evolution of HRSV in an unprecedented setting. We have taken advantage of this situation to reexamine the molecular epidemiology of HRSV and to explore the natural history of this important human pathogen.},

In such graphs, common subsequences are encoded as vertices and the genomic variations are captured by introducing additional labeled vertices and directed edges. Unlike a linear reference, a reference graph allows a rich representation of the genomic diversities and avoids reference bias. We address the fundamental problem of mapping reads to genome variation graphs. We give a novel mapping algorithm V-MAP for efficient identification of small subgraph of the genome graph for optimal gapped alignment of the read. V-MAP creates space efficient index using locality sensitive minimizer signatures computed using a novel graph winnowing and graph embedding onto metric space for fast and accurate mapping. Experiments involving graph constructed from the 1000 Genomes data and using both real and simulated reads show that V-MAP is fast, memory efficient and can map short reads, as well as PacBio/Nanopore long reads with high accuracy. V-MAP performance was significantly better than the state-of-the-art, especially for long reads.},

  abstract = {An RNA virus population does not consist of a single genotype; rather, it is an ensemble of related sequences, termed quasispecies1,2,3,4. Quasispecies arise from rapid genomic evolution powered by the high mutation rate of RNA viral replication5,6,7,8. Although a high mutation rate is dangerous for a virus because it results in nonviable individuals, it has been hypothesized that high mutation rates create a `cloud' of potentially beneficial mutations at the population level, which afford the viral quasispecies a greater probability to evolve and adapt to new environments and challenges during infection4,9,10,11. Mathematical models predict that viral quasispecies are not simply a collection of diverse mutants but a group of interactive variants, which together contribute to the characteristics of the population4,12. According to this view, viral populations, rather than individual variants, are the target of evolutionary selection4,12. Here we test this hypothesis by examining the consequences of limiting genomic diversity on viral populations. We find that poliovirus carrying a high-fidelity polymerase replicates at wild-type levels but generates less genomic diversity and is unable to adapt to adverse growth conditions. In infected animals, the reduced viral diversity leads to loss of neurotropism and an attenuated pathogenic phenotype. Notably, using chemical mutagenesis to expand quasispecies diversity of the high-fidelity virus before infection restores neurotropism and pathogenesis. Analysis of viruses isolated from brain provides direct evidence for complementation between members in the quasispecies, indicating that selection indeed occurs at the population level rather than on individual variants. Our study provides direct evidence for a fundamental prediction of the quasispecies theory and establishes a link between mutation rate, population dynamics and pathogenesis.},

RSV infection is seasonal in most countries; outbreaks occur most frequently in the cold season in areas with temperate and Mediterranean climates and in the wet season in tropical countries with seasonal rainfall. The situation on islands and in areas of the inner tropics with perennial high rainfall is less clear-cut. The age group mainly affected by RSV in developing countries is children under 6 months of age (mean 39\% of hospital patients with RSV). RSV-ALRI is slightly more common in boys than in girls. Very little information is available about the mortality of children infected with RSV, the frequency of bacterial co-infection, or the incidence of further wheezing after RSV. Further studies on RSV should address these questions in more detail. RSV is an important pathogen in young children in tropical and developing countries and a frequent cause of hospital admission. Prevention of RSV infection by vaccination would have a significant impact on the incidence of ALRI in children in developing countries.},

  abstract = {Kraken is an ultrafast and highly accurate program for assigning taxonomic labels to metagenomic DNA sequences. Previous programs designed for this task have been relatively slow and computationally expensive, forcing researchers to use faster abundance estimation programs, which only classify small subsets of metagenomic data. Using exact alignment of k-mers, Kraken achieves classification accuracy comparable to the fastest BLAST program. In its fastest mode, Kraken classifies 100 base pair reads at a rate of over 4.1 million reads per minute, 909 times faster than Megablast and 11 times faster than the abundance estimation program MetaPhlAn. Kraken is available at http://ccb.jhu.edu/software/kraken/.},

For example, representing structural variants of cancer genomes as a genome graph is more natural than representing such genomes as differences from the linear reference genome. While more and more structural variants are being identified by long-read sequencing, many of them are difficult to visualize using existing structural variants visualization tools. To this end, visualization method for large genome graphs such as human cancer genome graphs is demanded.},

  abstract = {Next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have been applied extensively in many areas of genetics and genomics research. A fundamental problem when comes to analyzing NGS data is mapping short sequencing reads back to the reference genome. Most of existing software packages rely on a single uniform reference genome and do not automatically take into the consideration of genetic variants. On the other hand, large proportions of incorrectly mapped reads affect the correct interpretation of the NGS experimental results. As an example, Degner et al. showed that detecting allele-specific expression from RNA sequencing data was biased toward the reference allele. In this study, we developed a method that utilize DirectX 11 enabled graphics processing unit (GPU)'s parallel computing power to produces a personalized diploid reference genome based on all known genetic variants of that particular individual. We show that using such a personalized diploid reference genome can improve mapping accuracy and significantly reduce the bias toward reference allele in allele-specific expression analysis. Our method can be applied to any individual that has genotype information obtained either from array-based genotyping or resequencing. Besides the reference genome, no additional changes to alignment algorithm are needed for performing read mapping therefore one can utilize any of the existing read mapping tools and achieve the improved read mapping result. C++ and GPU compute shader source code of the software program is available at: http://code.google.com/p/diploid-mapping/downloads/list.},

  abstract = {BackgroundThe Smith-Waterman algorithm, which produces the optimal pairwise alignment between two sequences, is frequently used as a key component of fast heuristic read mapping and variation detection tools for next-generation sequencing data. Though various fast Smith-Waterman implementations are developed, they are either designed as monolithic protein database searching tools, which do not return detailed alignment, or are embedded into other tools. These issues make reusing these efficient Smith-Waterman implementations impractical. ResultsTo facilitate easy integration of the fast Single-Instruction-Multiple-Data Smith-Waterman algorithm into third-party software, we wrote a C/C++ library, which extends Farrar's Striped Smith-Waterman (SSW) to return alignment information in addition to the optimal Smith-Waterman score. In this library we developed a new method to generate the full optimal alignment results and a suboptimal score in linear space at little cost of efficiency. This improvement makes the fast Single-Instruction-Multiple-Data Smith-Waterman become really useful in genomic applications. SSW is available both as a C/C++ software library, as well as a stand-alone alignment tool at: https://github.com/mengyao/Complete-Striped-Smith-Waterman-Library. ConclusionsThe SSW library has been used in the primary read mapping tool MOSAIK, the split-read mapping program SCISSORS, the MEI detector TANGRAM, and the read-overlap graph generation program RZMBLR. The speeds of the mentioned software are improved significantly by replacing their ordinary Smith-Waterman or banded Smith-Waterman module with the SSW Library.},
