Using the distances matrix, we were able to cluster closely related samples
together inferring this relatedness based on how they mapped to the graph. 

The infant in the household was member 502 from whom only a single sample was
sequenced. Hierarchical clustering of household dataset, zoomed in in
Figure [[fig:clado-infant]], shows that member 506 had the earliest closest sample
to that of the infant 502 and 528.
The closest sample to the infant is from member 528.
We also see that member 518, a school going eleven year old, has their samples
sit on their own.
Also interesting to note is member 508, a two-year-old, had their sample cluster
very closely to that of the infant.

When it comes to the entire household, the cladogram in Figure [[fig:clado-household]] shows three
clades circulating in household five annotated using red, blue and green rectangles.
In terms of when samples were taken, it is interesting to note that all but one
(504) of the samples collected in March cluster together in the clade
highlighted in red while the samples collected in April cluster in the clades
annotated in blue and green.

It is worth noting that despite only showing a rooted tree, both rooted and
unrooted neighbour trees can be generated by this method.
