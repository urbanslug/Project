\section{Background Information}
\label{sec:orgbfaff01}

RSV was first isolated in Chimpanzees in 1956 and named Chimpanzee Coryza Agent
\cite{morrisRecoveryCytopathogenicAgent1956}. 
A year later, in 1957, it was isolated in children from
whom it had not been possible to isolate and renamed Respiratory Syncytial
Virus \cite{beemAssociationChimpanzeeCoryza1960,chanockRecoveryInfantsRespiratory1957,zlatevaGeneticVariabilityMolecular2005}.

During the first year of life, RSV is the most frequent cause of acute lower
respiratory tract infection bringing infants between one and six months of age
into the hospital with pneumonia, bronchitis
\cite{stottRespiratorySyncytialVirus1985,zlatevaMolecularEvolutionCirculation2004,borchersRespiratorySyncytialVirus2013}, 
and otitis \cite{kleinRoleRespiratorySyncytial1982} and significantly increases the prevalence of
asthma amongst children who are hospitalized with RSV in infancy or early
childhood \cite{borchersRespiratorySyncytialVirus2013}. Moreover, there is a marked correlation
between the incidence of RSV in the community and the occurrence of sudden
infant deaths in children above 3 months of age \cite{chanockRecoveryInfantsRespiratory1957}.
A simple upper respiratory illness in high-risk immunocompromised adults is no
longer viewed as trivial \cite{whimbeyRespiratorySyncytialVirus2000}. 
People with cardiopulmonary diseases and immunocompromised persons with bone
marrow transplant patients prior to marrow engraftment are at highest risk for
pneumonia and death \cite{morrisRecoveryCytopathogenicAgent1956}.
For cancer patients, the risks and benefits of
administering intensive chemotherapy in the setting of a seemingly benign upper
respiratory illness are now weighed heavily \cite{kleinRoleRespiratorySyncytial1982}.

In animals, the virus is recognized as an important cause of Bovine Respiratory
Disease (BRD) in Europe and the United States \cite{whimbeyRespiratorySyncytialVirus2000}.

In terms of its epidemiology, it produces an annual epidemic of predominantly 
upper respiratory tract infections in children and healthy adults
\cite{chanockRecoveryInfantsRespiratory1957} with re-infections occurring throughout
life even in the presence of pre-existing antibodies \cite{sullenderGeneticDiversityAttachment1991}.
\section{Problem Statement}
\label{sec:orgddd5a1f}
Conventional methods of describing diversity involve comparing each sample
against a given reference genome instead of comparing every sample against every
other sample \cite{patenGenomeGraphsEvolution2017}. This comparison is
non-transitive meaning that the way a sample varies from the reference does not
expressly tell us how that sample varies from a separate sample. 
\section{Justification}
\label{sec:org4b1f6c6}
A reference genome graph is a robust data structure for representing genome
variation unlike the current approach where we compare a sample against a
linear reference genome. Given that consensus sequences are a mosaic of
haplotypes, we would like to make use of genome graph to disentangle the
sequence diversity present in RSV sequences, and potentially other respiratory
viruses. 
\section{Objectives}
\label{sec:orgb1a433e}
\subsection{Main Objective}
\label{sec:org269e4c4}
To construct an RSV variation graph from samples collected from a single
household in the course of an RSV household outbreak.
\subsection{Specific Objectives}
\label{sec:org7f7b06c}
\begin{enumerate}
\item To perform a review of existing genome graph tools used in constructing pangenome graphs.
\item To construct a variation graph from a set of samples collected from a single
household during the course of an RSV epidemic.
\end{enumerate}
