We provide a simple yet intuitionistic approach of comparing samples which
 facilitates an all versus comparison of samples without going through the 
reference as is the norm. This method involves using the depth of coverage under 
each node to  generate cladogram through neighbour joining. 
It provided a parsimonious tree that  correctly differentiated simulated
 SARS-CoV-2 reads and split a household RSV dataset to have two different
 introductions.

Future work will involve verifying that these trees are in fact differentiating these samples correctly and how it compares to contemporary methods of phylogenetics.
