SRA (Sequence Read Archive) NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information) is a source of open sequence data.

SRA Toolkit is a tool used to download data from them in case one isn't using a browser

* Install

** Guix

#+END_SRC


* Usage 
The docs for each of the subtools is here: https://trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/sra/sra.cgi?view=toolkit_doc
What I care about most is fastq-dump
** fasq-dump
In my case what I care about is the fastq-dump: Convert SRA data into fastq format 
whose documentation can be found [[https://trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/sra/sra.cgi?view=toolkit_doc&f=fastq-dump][fastq-dump]].

To download data paired end Illumina data I use:

To download interleaved reads
#+BEGIN_SRC
fastq-dump <accession number>
#+END_SRC

To download forward and reverse reads into separate files
#+BEGIN_SRC
fastq-dump --split-files <accession number>
#+END_SRC
