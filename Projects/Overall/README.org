Render each (bio)sample as a coverage vector across a reference pangenome graph.

Procedure:
 1. Get two sets of reads from the same genotype/species
 2. Using one set: build a reference pangenome graph
 3. Using the other set: map it into the reference graph
 4. Get the fraction of the graph that the read set covers
 5. Comapere with a set from a completely different species

Biological questions answerable
 1. Given a sample (reads in fastq), how well does it align to the graph?
