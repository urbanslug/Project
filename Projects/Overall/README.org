Render each (bio)sample as a coverage vector across a reference pangenome graph
Procedure:
 1. Build a reference pangenome graph
 2. Map a read set into the reference graph
 3. Get the fraction of the graph that the read set covers

Biological questions answerable
 1. Given a sample (reads in fastq), how well does it align to the graph?
