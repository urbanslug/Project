* Data
** Overall
A prospective study of 47 households (493 individuals) in rural Kenya,
followed through a 6-month period of an RSV seasonal outbreak.

Deep nasopharyngeal swabs were collected twice each week from all
household members, irrespective of symptoms, and tested for RSV by multiplex PCR.

The RSV G gene was sequenced. 

A total of 205 RSV infection episodes were detected in 179 individuals from 40 different households.

*** Results
The infection data were interval censored and assuming a random event time between observations,
the average duration of virus shedding was 11·2 (95% confidence interval 10·1–12·3) days. 
The shedding durations were longer than previous estimates (3·9–7·4 days)
based on immunofluorescence antigen detection or
viral culture, and were shown to be strongly associated with age, 
severity of infection, and revealed potential interaction with other respiratory viruses.

We then focus on household 5

* Household 5
Viruses from households 5, 31 and 40 formed individual distinct 
household-specific clusters that included all virus genomes
obtained from these households.

In contrast, households 26, 38 and 57 had genomes from 2 or more
 separate branches, suggesting multiple virus introductions into
each of these three households.

* Terms
 - prospective cohort study :: is a longitudinal cohort study that follows over
time a group of similar individuals (cohorts) who differ with respect
to certain factors under study, to determine how these factors
affect rates of a certain outcome.
