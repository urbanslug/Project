Generate a sufficiently simple (de Bruijn) graph using an assembler suited to the data
Let's use the simulated data from [[./Data.org][the previous data step]].

* Pangenome graph generation
Tools that can build a de Bruijn graph from reads


** spades
*** Output
A graph in gfa1 and fastg

The graph from spades doesn't render continously in gfa and seems to be made up of different non connected graphs
as seen below but runs through astarix successfully

** minia3

** bifrost

** bcalm2

* Parameters
** kmer size
Picking a kmer size is...

** minimum abundance

* Bluntify the reference genome graph

* Organize the graph


** odgi sort
