* Introduction

There are four major overlapping steps that need to be carried out after DNA
sequencing to get actionable results. 1) fragment assembly which involves
recreating the original genetic sequence; 2) alignment, mapping, indexing and
querying which are part of the assembly stage but can be done later to query the
relatedness of sequences; and 3) Visualization to see these changes
