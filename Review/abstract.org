Evolution for the most part is dependent on changes in the genome of an organism. 
It is impossible to separate variation from genomes, in fact, change is so 
inherent in DNA that it happens in everyday cell division (somatic cells). 
This means that not only is the DNA of each species different from the other but
that of each individual is different.
Despite this, through the use of a linear reference genome, most methods, up
until recently treated DNA within a species as if it were static across time or
updating at regular intervals, homogenous between individuals
(the same across a species), and not polymorphic. This has led to the reference 
bias problem; a tendency of the reference to over-report sequences present in 
it and under-report those that are not.
The current model works because genomes within a species donâ€™t
vary by much (one change per thousand nucleotides?) but as
(individualized) medicine, vaccine research looking into pathogen mutation
and other fields that require finer-grained results from genetics
it begins to show its flaws.

Genome graphs have been shown to reduce reference bias by 
representing less frequently occurring sequences as alternative nodes or edges.

We reviewed genome graphs chronologically from some of their earilest uses up 
to their most recent advancements and also how they are used at various stages
of analyses from fragment assembly all the way to visualization.
